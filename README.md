the character is an English alphabet in small case, it is converted to upper
case and printed out. If the character is an English alphabet in upper case,
it is converted to lower case and printed out. If the character is not an
English alphabet in small case, then it is kept unchanged and printed out.

(e) S = 2+4+6+….up to nth terms

Assignment 7
1. Write a C program to generate Fibonacci sequence up to nth term where n
is an input have to be taken from the keyboard. Write a main program to
test it. The Fibonacci numbers are generated by setting F0=0, F1=1 and
using the following formula to get the rest.
Fn = Fn-1+Fn-2
2. Write a C program to compute the sum of the numbers between 20 to 30
and divisible by 2 and 3.
